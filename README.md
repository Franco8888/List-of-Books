# List-of-Books
A QT(C++) GUI application that manages a list of book titles. 

The user is able to add book titles using a text entry and a button. As the titles are added, they are displayed alphabetically.

The application does not allow duplicate titles and the user is warned when the user try to add a duplicate name. 

The user may edit the books by double clicking in the titles in the list. When these books are altered, they are again displayed alphabetically.

The user may delete book entries by clicking on the titles and then pressing the ‘Delete ‘Entry button’.
